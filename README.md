# SNA_project
Project for the course Social Network Analysis.
Code created by Naom√Ø Broersma, Bonne Jongsma and Iris Kamsteeg.

## Before running the code
Install all requirements using: pip install -r requirements.txt.
All relevant data is already part of the Github.
The relevant dictionaries for creating the graphs have already been created
and are also added as json files.

## Variables in main.py
Currently, CREATE_STRUCTURE_FILES is set to False, so you do not have to create
the full dictionaries and read those in as graphs. 
The dictionaries are already given as files.

Instead, the relevant structure file will be opened.
You can set non_rumour_bool, rumour_bool and full_bool to True/False
to run either the non-rumour, rumour or full graph.
Only the first one that is set to True will run for all code.

## How to run the code
In the terminal, type python3 main.py to run the code.
